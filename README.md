# RocketSystemProjectTemplate

Provides a working template for creating new RocketSystem Projects.

1. Replace "rocketsystemprojecttemplate" with "newprojectname" case-sensitive in Project 
2. Replace "RocketSystemProjectTemplate" with "NewProjectName" case-sensitive in Project 
3. Rename Project files
4. Rename Solution files
5. Rename Resx File.
6. Rename DNN manifest.

The system uses the RocketPortal>RocketAdmin skin on the admin page which will call the AdminPanel.  

DO NOT FORGET:  Add any new commands into the "SystemDefaults.rules" file.

The current project code uses DNNpacker.
